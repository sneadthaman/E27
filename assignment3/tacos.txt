Mexican Street Tacos

There is nothing more American than Mexican food! Our neighbors to the South have blessed us with a vibrant pallette of flavors that are quite accessible for the less adventurous. The key to a good taco is a good hard corn taco shell. https://www.amazon.com/Garden-Eatin-Yellow-Dinner-Count/dp/B00DEXNZCK/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=hard+corn+taco+shell&qid=1614783525&sr=8-2

My local supermarket carries these and they are perfect (other than fresh ones which, let's be honest, aren't available most times). The thing I love about cooking tacos is the flexibility to change, modify, add or subtract ingredients on the fly. It's a great way to consume a lot of different foods. When calling audibles, make sure to combine different textures and flavors to get the full taco experience. This is a very simple dish to prepare and only requires a few 'core' ingredients. I also recommend buying a taco holder for the plate - it adds a layer of stability and aesthetic.

Serves: ~4 (depends how hungry they are!)

Ingredients:

-- Box of hard corn shells (12 in a box, you will use at least 6 of them)
-- 1lb ground pork*
-- Mexican Spice**
-- Peruvian Spice***
-- 1/2 red onion, finely sliced
-- 1 can of corn, drained
-- 1 jalapeno, cored, seeded, finely sliced into half-rounds
-- 2 limes (we will zest and juice one later, the second lime is just for serving)
-- 1/2 shallot, halved and finely sliced
-- Tomato Paste (or chipotle paste if you can get it)
-- 1/4 cup of chicken or beef stock (or just water if you don't have stock)
-- 1/4 cup of Sour Cream
-- Salt and Pepper

* You can use ground beef, or sliced chicken - cook times will be similar
** Experiment with your own blend of spices which should include: chili powder, paprika, ground cumin, garlic powder, onion powder, ground dried chipotle chili, dried oregano, Salt
*** I would buy this if you can - it will include dried Aji peppers. If you can't find this, substitute your mexican spice blend.

1. Heat a frying pan with a little olive oil (preferably non-stick) over medium-high heat and add red onion. Cook for about 3-5 minutes until onions are soft but not too brown.

2. Add ground pork and cook while breaking into smaller pieces for about 5-6 minutes, until pork is cooked through.

3. Add mexican spice mix and a good healthy squeeze of tomato paste and cook for another minute, stirring to combine. 

-- How much spice, you ask? At least 1 tablespoon, but this is entirely up to you and frankly you should be in charge of this department! Nobody wants bland pork.

4. Add chicken stock and reduce heat to medium-low and let this bubble down. This is where the flavors get concentrated!

5. When the liquid has all but evaporated, turn the heat off - we're done with the pork filling.

-- Don't forget to taste the pork filling at this point and adjust seasoning. We don't want any surprises when it comes time to serve!

6. In another pan, add drained corn and a little oil and cook on medium-high heat until corn is slightly browned - about 4-5 minutes. Cover pan if corn starts jumping! This will happen if there is still moisture on the corn. Hit the corn with the Peruvian spice about half-way through cooking.

7. In a small bowl, add jalapenos, shallots and juice from half of 1 lime. Season with salt and pepper and let this sit and marinate until time to serve.

8. In another small bowl, combine sour cream, zest from 1 lime, and a little water. Mix until crema is a drizzling consistency. Add more water if needed. Season with salt and pepper.

9. To assemble, add seasoned pork, then seasoned corn to each taco shell. Top with pickled jalapeno/shallot and finally drizzle with lime crema on top. 

Feel free to omit the corn and pickled vegetables and add shredded lettuce and shredded cheese. The variations are endless!
