PART 1: Advanced media queries (15 points)
 incorporate at least two types of advanced media queries. 
* And, not, or (comma-separated) queries 
* Queries that target devices (phones, tablets, desktop) 
* Queries that don't use width or height as tests
Media queries that you may use, but that don't count towards this requirement:
* Anything having to do with print - this is counted in part 2.
* A media query using and, not, or with a media type, i.e.   @media screen and (min-width: 500px) -- c'mon, you can do better than this. Stretch further.

Part A: Rich search
Which type of rich search result did you choose?


On which page is this demonstrated?

ABOVE AND BEYOND (10 POINTS)
Identify what you did for Above and Beyond. Provide any relevant HTML, CSS, or Sass line number(s) and explanation of what you did. How many points do you think this was worth, and why?


Suggestions:
* Consider marking up a page or part of a page using microdata. This should not be combined with the rich search result information in part 2.
* Go way beyond on the print stylesheets, creating something wildly different in print. (Think about when you print tickets, shipping labels, etc.)
* We are always open to other ideas.
