ABOVE AND BEYOND (16 POINTS)


Identify what you did for Above and Beyond. Provide any relevant HTML,
CSS, or Sass line number(s) and explanation of what you did. How many
points do you think this was worth, and why? You can do more than one
thing if you want.
If you add code features, add matching docs for full credit.

The whole project is wrapped up into a single web page which explains how to use the framework, and is also itself leveraging the framework. For the above and beyond, I created a cool custom component using the 'aside' and corresponding 'p' tag to make a old terminal prompt styled element. I think the overall aesthetic is quite lovely and should be used , for the most part, out of the box. 16 points!
